AI-course Elements of AI 2

## Summary
This is a description or idea of a AI application usin gneural network approach to identify drugs to be used for other than intended use. Building AI course project

## Bckground
AI techniques can analyze large-scale biomedical data to identify existing drugs that may have therapeutic potential for different diseases than originally intended. By reusing allreaddy approved drugs for new indications AI might accelerates the drug application discovery.

## Data and AI
Neural network-based approach in treatment decisions using data sources from patient records and lab results in order to identify new areas of treatments for non intended diseases. The data sources should be collected and treated with care and only after getting permission from patients. Adresseing the positive side affects from medicines used for other purposes would be one way to use AI within the field of the drug applications domain.

## How is it used
The results should be used to address illness/deseases that are not treatable with designated drugs/medecins. BY analyzing lab results from a large amount of patients it might be possible to find positive side affects in an faster way than manually. 

## Challanges
Finding posiutive side affactes might be difficult if the prerequisites is small, ie. dependent on a unique combination of drugs, patients DNA or other factors that might not show a "pattern".

## What next
Getting access to medical data and also the proper resources to test the project is neede. It might be a problem getting patients to agree to let their data be used by a third party.

## Acknowledgment
No code is used as of now.
